# Naive-Bees-Image-classification
* Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, we will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. we'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.

This is a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.

## 1. Image Loading and Processing
* Load, transform, and understand images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.
## 2. Predict Species from Images
* Build a model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.
## 3. Deep Learning with Images
* Build a deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.
